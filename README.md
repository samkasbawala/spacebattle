# Spaceship Battle
This is a simple game which has been created to get familiar with the pygame library. All credits go to Tech With Tim as his tutorial was followed. Of course, I have made a few small changes, mostly with how the code is organized, but the game itself is almost exactly the same as Tim's. Again, a huge thank you to him for his great tutorial.

## Installation
This project was completed using Python 3.9. You can install Pyhton for you system [here](https://www.python.org/). I recommend using a virtual envirnoment. To install the dependencies run:
`pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

## Running the game
